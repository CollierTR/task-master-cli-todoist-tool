# Task Master - A Todoist integration for rescheduling your default time blocks to specific goals

## Set up and configuration
 - download the repository
 - create a file at the route of the directory named .env (I'm going to make a script for this...)
 - paste this into your newly created file and follow the comments for more details

 ```ini
# Replace the values with your API keys
# just delete the entire line for any you don't want to use.
TODOIST_API_KEY = "00000000000000000000000000000000000000"

# note: do not delete the .gitignore file or you might leak your API keys
 ```

- run the command ```taskmaster``` and you are will be up and running!
